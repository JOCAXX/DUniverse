Some articles by Jocax  
======================

´The “Decreasing Universe” model: an alternative perspective to accelerated expansion'

"The understanding of the universe’s evolution has been dominated
by the Standard Cosmological Model, known as ?-CDM. This widely
accepted model postulates the existence of dark matter and, crucially,
dark energy to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the
universe.1 However, dark energy remains an entity of unknown and
undetectable origin, presenting a significant theoretical challenge.2..."

´The Universe, According to Jocax'

"We will address some of the main questions regarding our Universe, such as theories about its origins, types of Universes (Virtual
Universe, Parallel Universes), and questions about its finiteness, purpose, eternity, and its end."

-------------
´Decreasing Universe: The CMB and the Age of the Universe'

" We will use the “Decreasing Universe” (D.U.) theory to estimate the age of the Universe based on
the average wavelength of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.
Keywords: Decreasing Universe, CMB, Universe Age, L-CDM".

´Decreasing Universe: The 'Dark Matter' Effect'

"After a brief review of the Decreasing Universe (D.U.) model, we will derive a formula and the graph for the apparent velocity of
stars (of a Messier_33 galaxy) as a function of their radial distance from the galactic center. This formula reproduces the same
velocity curve traditionally attributed to dark matter. "

´Decreasing Universe: Redshifts and Distance Data Refute the L-CDM Mode'

"To evaluate and compare the “Decreasing Universe theory” with the LCDM model, I created a potentially falsifiable prediction
and the data was extracted and analyzed."

-------------
´Decreasing universe: the distance as a function of redshift'

"Using the “Decreasing Universe” model1 we will show evidence that this new model of the
dynamics of the Universe is less disruptive and more adequate than the traditional ?-CDM
model that postulates the existence of Dark Energy.
We will also develop, from this new theory, a simple and straightforward mathematical
formula that provides the distance of the galaxy as a function of its redshift."

´Derivation of Hubble’s Law and its relation to dark energy and dark matter'

"From the “Decreasing Universe” model,1,2 establishing the contraction of space tissue when
exposed to a gravitational field, we derive the Hubble Law and, from there, we will explain
the effect “Dark Energy” ".

´Jocaxian’s Train'

"This article presents two simple and analog situations related to
classic mental experience known as “Einstein’s Train”, which explains
the temporal dilatation regarding special relativity theory, and then it
points a logical contradiction between them."

-------------
´The Equivalence Principle and the End of the Dark Energy'

"We will make a new approach for an effect known as “Dark Energy” by an effect on gravitatio nal field.[1]
In an accelerated rocket, the dimensions of space towards movement due to „Lorentz Contraction" are
on continuous reduction.Using the equivalence principle, we presume that in the gravitational field, the same
thing would happen.In this implicates in „dark energy effect". The calculi show that in a 7%-contraction for each
billion years would explain our observation of galaxies in accelerated separation."

´The Gravitational Field and the Dark Energy'

"I herein write on a new idea about cosmology that seeks to solve the dark energy and darkmatter problem by eliminating the need to postulate its existence.

´Jocaxian’s time definition'

"Time has always been a mystery of philosophy and physics since its beginnings. We propose
a new definition of time that, in addition to being objective, promotes a better understanding
of this very important concept."
