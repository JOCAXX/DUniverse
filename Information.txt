The Age of Galaxies as a Determining Factor for Redshift:
An Analysis from the Perspective of the Decreasing Universe Theory

"The Decreasing Universe (D.U.) theory proposes that the gravitational field induces a continuous contraction of space, offering an alternative explanation for cosmological redshift. 

A crucial and logical deduction from this theory is that a galaxy's time of exposure to the gravitational field, i.e., its age, should directly influence the observed redshift. 

Older galaxies,having accumulated more time under spatial contraction, should exhibit a smaller redshift.

This article examines this prediction, using the observed redshift difference between old (elliptical) and young (spiral) galaxies in clusters as a primary observational test for the D.U. theory."

Analysis of Mass-Redshift Correlation in Velocity Matched Subgroups: A Rigorous Test for the Decreasing Universe Theory

The Decreasing Universe (D.U.) theory proposes that the gravitational field induces a continuous spatial contraction, predicting that more massive galaxies should exhibit a smaller
redshift at the same distance. 

The main obstacle to testing this prediction is the noise introduced by the galaxies' peculiar velocities. This study applies a rigorous methodology to isolate the effect of mass by analyzing the correlation between stellar mass and redshift in galaxy subgroups with controlled distance, age, and radial velocity. 

The results show that, by minimizing dynamical noise, the negative correlation predicted by the D.U. theory emerges in specific subsamples, suggesting that the intrinsic gravitational effect may be detectable.
